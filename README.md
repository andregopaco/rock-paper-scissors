# rock-paper-scissors
My first javascript project for the Odin Project.

Some thoughts before starting the whole process:
I already done a rock paper scissors game before, using Python. I guess it means that I've already done the algorithm before. It's time to implement it in a different language.  Let's see how it goes.

---- update ----

Seems to me that I've finished the game on its -console- mode. Easier said than done! Lots of if elses... the two main bugs I made were A) a syntax error regarding the non-usage of parenthesis on a function; B) a problem originated from calling a function inside itself - turns out I ended up with an undefined variable that messed up a bunch of other things.

--- new-branch update / rps-ui ---

Starting to develop an user interface so the player does not have to play through the console. Also, I'm learning how to use branch/merge in Github. :)
